# Flexible-Modification-of-Gauss-Newton-Method

There are many modifications of the Gauss-Newton algorithm that solves the problem of minimizing the Euclidean norm of a certain vector function.
In this project I want to compare two modifications of the Gauss-Newton method according to Nesterov among themselves.
