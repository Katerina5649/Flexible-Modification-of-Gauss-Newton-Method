# Flexible-Modification-of-Gauss-Newton-Method

There are many modifications of the Gauss-Newton algorithm that solves the problem of minimizing the Euclidean norm of a certain vector function.
$$\min _{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}}\left\{f_{1}(x) \stackrel{\text { def }}{=}\|F(x)\|\right\}$$
In this project I want to compare two modifications of the Gauss-Newton method according to Nesterov among themselves.
